# Online-Learning-SMSD-Large-Dataset

In this paper, we propose an online method to learning the sensing matrix and dictionary simultaneously on a large dataset. The simulation results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

To run these codes, please download the OMP toolbox to solve the sparse coding procedure. The link is:

Note that do not forget to add the path in your own matlab path.

Our main algorithm is shown in `Online_Sens_DIC_simultaneously.m'. We also propose one demo to show how to run our code. 

Remark: The traindata and testdata should be stored as X and X_test.

To obtain how to utilize the related function in this toolbox, just run `help function_name’.
